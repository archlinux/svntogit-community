    Patch config files with Arch Linux specific locations
    
    Arch uses upstream's default config files as a base for its configs.
    But directory structure at Arch is completely different from the default
    one specified by gitlab project.
    We used to have a lot of seds expressions to adjust the files but as
    complexity of configs grew 'sed' makes it easy to miss a changed/added
    option.
    
    Track set of diffs as a patch. If upstream modifies config file then it
    will cause a conflict that needs to be reviewed manually.
