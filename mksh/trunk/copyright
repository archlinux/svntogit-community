$MirOS: contrib/hosted/tg/deb/mksh/debian/copyright,v 1.25.4.1 2011/08/03 13:04:12 tg Exp $

It was downloaded via "debian/rules get-orig-source". This both
makes using CVS snapshots easier and is needed because upstream
distfiles are in cpio format, and tar-in-tar is discouraged.

The debconf templates were taken from the dash source package;
updated translations were contributed via the Debian BTS and
other means.


Licence:

The MirBSD Korn Shell is covered by the MirOS Licence, which
is OSI approved, as reproduced below.

Binaries of the MirBSD Korn Shell on systems whose libc does
not provide a strlcpy function will additionally contain an
implementation under the ISC Licence, which is OSI approved
and also reproduced below.

All Debian binaries of mksh R39 and up also pull in the UCB code
SLOB printf.c to have a printf(1) builtin (also OSI approved).

mksh16.xpm is hand-drawn; mksh16lg.xpm and mksh32.xpm are exports
