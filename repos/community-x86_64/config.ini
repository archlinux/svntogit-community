; Hi there! This is the configuration file for
; Kresus. Please make sure to read all the options before setting up
; Kresus for the first time.
; 
[kresus]

; This is where Kresus stores additional data, as the latest bank
; scrapping modules. It should be writeable by the user which launches
; the Kresus executable.
; Can be removed; defaults to "HOME_DIR/.kresus".
; Overriden by the KRESUS_DIR environment variable, if it's set.
; Example:
; datadir=/home/ben/.kresus
datadir=/var/lib/kresus

; This is the port that Kresus will run on. It is recommended not
; to expose it on port 80 directly but to use a reverse-proxy
; configuration like Nginx, Caddy or Apache.
; Can be removed; defaults to "9876".
; Overriden by the PORT environment variable, if it's set.
; Example:
; port=9876
port=9876

; The host on which the Kresus server will listen to.
; Can be removed; defaults to "127.0.0.1".

; The directory prefix in the URL, if Kresus is to be served from a
; subdirectory. For instance, if your website is hosted at example.com
; and the url prefix is "money", then Kresus will be reachable at
; example.com/money. By default, it's '', meaning that Kresus has its own
; subdomain.
; Can be removed; defaults to "".
; Overriden by the KRESUS_URL_PREFIX environment variable, if it's set.
; Example:
; url_prefix=/money
url_prefix=

; Example:
; sources_list=/home/ben/code/weboob/sources.list
