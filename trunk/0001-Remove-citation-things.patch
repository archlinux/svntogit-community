-    # Funding a free software project is hard. GNU Parallel is no
-    # exception. On top of that it seems the less visible a project
-    # is, the harder it is to get funding. And the nature of GNU
-    # Parallel is that it will never be seen by "the guy with the
-    # checkbook", but only by the people doing the actual work.
-    #
-    # This problem has been covered by others - though no solution has
-    # been found:

-    # The FAQ tells you why the citation notice exists:
-    # https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/parallel.git/tree/doc/citation-notice-faq.txt
-    #
-    # If you want GNU Parallel to be maintained in the future, and not
-    # just wither away like so many other free software tools, you
-    # need to help finance the development.
-    #
-    # The citation notice is a simple way of doing so, as citations
-    # makes it possible to me to get a job where I can maintain GNU
-    # Parallel as part of the job.
-    #
-    # This means you can help financing development
-    #
-    #	WITHOUT PAYING A SINGLE CENT!
-    #
-    # Before implementing the citation notice it was discussed with
-    # the users:
-    # https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/parallel/2013-11/msg00006.html
-    #
-    # Having to spend 10 seconds on running 'parallel --citation' once
-    # is no doubt not an ideal solution, but no one has so far come up
-    # with an ideal solution - neither for funding GNU Parallel nor
-    # other free software.
-    #
-    # If you believe you have the perfect solution, you should try it
-    # out, and if it works, you should post it on the email
-    # list. Ideas that will cost work and which have not been tested
-    # are, however, unlikely to be prioritized.
-    #
-    # Please note that GPL version 3 gives you the right to fork GNU
-    # Parallel under a new name, but it does not give you the right to
-    # distribute modified copies with the citation notice disabled in
-    # a way where the software can be confused with GNU Parallel. To
-    # do that you need to be the owner of the GNU Parallel
-    # trademark. The xt:Commerce case shows this.
