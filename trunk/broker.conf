# The Choria broker can host your middleware, federation brokers and protocol adapters
# all in one binary or even one process.
#
# You can enable all the below features and run just one `choria broker` instance to
# use them all.  For federation and Adapters you can scale horizontally across nodes
# and the network broker supports clustering as below
#
# At least 1 feature has to be enabled else it will exit.

# Setting up a protocol adapter to publish registration messages to NATS Streaming
#
# Here a listener is setup on the collective and received all messages from the
# discovery subsystem and republish them to NATS Streaming.  This creates a log
# like Kafka from where you can consume the stream of data, go back in time,
# etc using your own client code to build whatever integration you want

#   plugin.choria.adapter.cmdb.ingest.workers = 10 # default
#
# This is the side that rewrites to the stream, messages are published as
# JSON to a topic my.cmdb, payload has body, sender and time.  Body is
# Base64 encoded
